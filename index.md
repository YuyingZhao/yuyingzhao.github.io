I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. [Tyler Derr](https://tylersnetwork.github.io/) and a member of the [Network and Data Science (NDS) lab](https://nds-vu.github.io/). I completed my BS and MS in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2018 and 2021, respectively, where I received the university’s “Outstanding Graduate” award for both my BS degree and MS degree.

## **Research Interest**
My research interests lie in responsible AI focusing on beyond-utility perspectives including fairness, explainability, and diversity. Additionally, I am fascinated by the powerful representation ability of graphs. I am broadly interested in analyzing all kinds of graph data, ranging from social media networks, coauthorship relationships, dating networks, biology graphs, EHR graphs in the healthcare domain, and so on.

<!-- My research interests lie in the interface of Machine Learning and Graph Mining with specific focuses on: Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks, Explainable Graph Neural Networks. I am fascinated by the powerful representation ability of graphs. I am broadly interested in analyzing all kinds of graph data, ranging from social media networks, coauthorship relationships, biology graphs, EHR graphs in the healthcare domain, and so on.-->

<!-- My current research focus is dynamic graph learning. I have conducted research on influence maximization and plan to use machine learning techniques to further explore this field. Instead of focusing on the theoretical guarantee, I hope to see what other interesting patterns and contents can be driven from the diffusion process to better understand human behavior. For example, learn how the influence between two individuals might change. -->
